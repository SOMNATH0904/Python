## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Python programming concepts and basic code examples to help you grasp the foundational aspects of Python. Each concept is accompanied by a brief explanation and sample code to illustrate its usage.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python-Programming.git
    cd Python-Programming
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install necessary packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Basic Python Concepts

### Variables and Data Types

- **Variables:** Used to store data values.
- **Data Types:** Common data types include integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

    ```python
    # Example
    age = 25
    name = "John"
    is_student = True
    ```

### Control Structures

- **Conditional Statements:** `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- **Loops:** `for` and `while`.

    ```python
    # Example
    if age > 18:
        print("Adult")
    else:
        print("Minor")

    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
    ```

### Functions

- **Defining Functions:** Using the `def` keyword.
- **Arguments and Return Values:**

    ```python
    # Example
    def greet(name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

    print(greet("Alice"))
    ```

### Modules and Packages

- **Importing Modules:** Using the `import` statement.
- **Creating Packages:** Organizing code into modules and packages.

    ```python
    # Example
    import math

    print(math.sqrt(16))
    ```

### File Handling

- **Reading and Writing Files:**

    ```python
    # Example
    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    ```

### Error Handling

- **Try and Except Blocks:**

    ```python
    # Example
    try:
        value = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input!")
    ```

### Object-Oriented Programming

- **Classes and Objects:**

    ```python
    # Example
    class Dog:
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

        def bark(self):
            return "Woof!"

    my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
    print(my_dog.bark())
    ```
